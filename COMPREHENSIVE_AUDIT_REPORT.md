üîö CONCLUSION
The Task Tracker application has a solid architectural foundation but requires significant remediation work before production deployment. The codebase demonstrates good design patterns and separation of concerns, but critical implementation gaps, test failures, and security issues make it unsuitable for production use in its current state.

Recommendation: MAJOR REFACTORING REQUIRED

The application needs 3-4 months of focused development effort to reach production readiness. Priority should be given to fixing the test infrastructure, resolving critical dependencies, and completing missing service implementations.
