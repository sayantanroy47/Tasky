## Build Instructions

### Android Release Build

1. **Prepare for Release**
```bash
# Clean previous builds
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Generate app bundle (recommended)
flutter build appbundle --release

# Or generate APK
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
```

2. **Sign the App**
```bash
# Ensure keystore is configured in android/app/build.gradle
# Sign with your release keystore
```

3. **Verify Build**
```bash
# Install and test on device
flutter install --release
```

### iOS Release Build

1. **Prepare for Release**
```bash
# Clean previous builds
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Build iOS release
flutter build ios --release
```

2. **Archive in Xcode**
- Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode
- Select "Any iOS Device" as target
- Product â†’ Archive
- Distribute to App Store or TestFlight

## Deployment Process

### 1. Pre-Deployment Testing

#### System Health Check
```dart
// Run deployment readiness check
final deploymentService = DeploymentReadinessService(...);
final report = await deploymentService.performDeploymentReadinessCheck();

if (report.overallStatus != DeploymentStatus.ready) {
  // Address blockers and warnings before proceeding
  print('Deployment blocked: ${report.blockers}');
  print('Warnings: ${report.warnings}');
}
```

#### Performance Optimization
```dart
// Optimize for deployment
final optimizationReport = await deploymentService.optimizeForDeployment();
print('Optimizations applied: ${optimizationReport.optimizations}');
```

### 2. Store Deployment

#### Google Play Store
1. Upload signed app bundle to Google Play Console
2. Complete store listing with:
   - App description
   - Screenshots (phone, tablet, TV if applicable)
   - Feature graphic
   - Privacy policy link
   - Content rating

3. Configure release:
   - Target API level (minimum API 21)
   - Permissions justification
   - Data safety form

#### Apple App Store
1. Upload build via Xcode or Application Loader
2. Complete App Store Connect listing:
   - App description and keywords
   - Screenshots for all supported devices
   - App preview videos (optional)
   - Privacy policy and support URLs

3. Submit for review:
   - Ensure compliance with App Store guidelines
   - Provide test account if needed

### 3. Post-Deployment Monitoring

#### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor app startup times
- Track crash rates
- Watch memory usage patterns
- Monitor API response times

#### Error Tracking
```dart
// Error recovery service automatically tracks:
// - Crash reports
// - Error frequency
// - Recovery success rates
// - User impact metrics
```

#### Privacy Compliance
- Monitor consent rates
- Track data processing activities
- Ensure retention policies are enforced
- Regular compliance audits

## Configuration Management

### Environment Configuration
```dart
// lib/core/config/app_config.dart
class AppConfig {
  static const String environment = String.fromEnvironment('ENV', defaultValue: 'production');
  static const bool enableAnalytics = bool.fromEnvironment('ENABLE_ANALYTICS', defaultValue: false);
  static const bool enableCrashReporting = bool.fromEnvironment('ENABLE_CRASH_REPORTING', defaultValue: true);
}
```

### Build Variants
```bash
# Development build
flutter build apk --debug --dart-define=ENV=development

# Staging build
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=ENV=staging

# Production build
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=ENV=production
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback
1. **Identify Issue**
   - Monitor crash reports
   - Check user feedback
   - Review performance metrics

2. **Execute Rollback**
   - Revert to previous version in store
   - Communicate with users if necessary
   - Document incident

3. **Post-Rollback**
   - Investigate root cause
   - Fix issues in development
   - Plan re-deployment

### Gradual Rollback
- Use staged rollout features in app stores
- Monitor metrics during rollout
- Halt rollout if issues detected

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- App startup time
- Crash rate (< 1%)
- ANR rate (< 0.5%)
- Memory usage
- Battery consumption
- Network usage

### Alerting Thresholds
```dart
// Configure alerts for:
// - Crash rate > 2%
// - Startup time > 5 seconds
// - Memory usage > 200MB
// - Error rate > 5%
```

### Health Checks
```dart
// Automated health checks run every 10 minutes
final healthStatus = await systemIntegrationService.runSystemHealthChecks();
if (!healthStatus.isHealthy) {
  // Trigger alerts
  // Initiate recovery procedures
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### App Won't Start
1. Check system integration status
2. Verify all services initialized
3. Review crash logs
4. Check device compatibility

#### Performance Issues
1. Review performance metrics
2. Check for memory leaks
3. Analyze slow operations
4. Verify resource optimization

#### Privacy Compliance Issues
1. Verify consent management
2. Check data retention policies
3. Review data processing logs
4. Ensure compliance status

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check app health
flutter logs --verbose

# Performance profiling
flutter run --profile

# Memory analysis
flutter run --debug --enable-software-rendering
```
