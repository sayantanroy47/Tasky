# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Task Tracker App is a voice-driven, cross-platform mobile application designed to provide users with an intuitive and efficient way to manage their tasks. The app combines natural language processing with voice recognition to create a seamless task management experience that works offline-first while offering optional cloud synchronization.
