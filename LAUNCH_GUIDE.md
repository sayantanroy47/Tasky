## 🧠 **FREE AI Features (No API Costs!)**

Our **Enhanced Local Parser** provides surprisingly sophisticated AI-like functionality:

### **What It Does**
- 📅 **Smart Date Parsing**: "tomorrow", "next Friday", "in 3 days", "12/25"
- 🎯 **Priority Detection**: "urgent", "ASAP", "when I have time"
- 🏷️ **Auto-Tagging**: Detects work, personal, shopping, health contexts
- 📝 **Subtask Extraction**: Finds numbered lists and action sequences
- 🎨 **Category Assignment**: Intelligently categorizes tasks

### **Example Inputs**
```
"Call John about the urgent meeting tomorrow at 3 PM"
↓
Title: "Call John about the meeting"
Due Date: Tomorrow 3:00 PM
Priority: Urgent
Tags: [work, communication]
```

```
"Buy groceries: 1. Milk 2. Bread 3. Eggs when I have time this week"
↓  
Title: "Buy groceries"
Due Date: This Friday
Priority: Low
Tags: [shopping]
Subtasks: [Milk, Bread, Eggs]
```

## 🚨 **Known Limitations**

### **What's Not Included**
- ❌ Real-time collaboration (code exists, needs backend)
- ❌ Machine learning insights (basic analytics only)
- ❌ Enterprise SSO (basic auth only)
- ❌ Advanced calendar sync (basic integration only)

### **Resource Usage**
- **Storage**: ~50MB app + database
- **RAM**: ~100MB typical usage
- **Battery**: Optimized for all-day use
- **Network**: Minimal usage (cloud sync only)

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**"Voice input not working"**
→ Check microphone permissions in Settings

**"Location features disabled"**  
→ Enable location permissions and GPS

**"Export failed"**
→ Check storage permissions

**"App crashes on startup"**
→ Clear app data, restart

**"Database errors"**
→ App will auto-rebuild database on next start

### **Performance Issues**
- Large task lists (1000+): Use search/filters
- Slow voice processing: Check device microphone
- Export timeouts: Try smaller date ranges
